# Flutter FIAR

Four-in-a-row game in Flutter

## Game modes

At the moment only local **player vs player** mode is available.

I'm planning to add **player vs cpu** (with various difficulties) and remote **player vs player**

## Getting Started

Run the application to play :)

`git clone git@github.com:imtoori/flutter_fiar.git`

`flutter run`
